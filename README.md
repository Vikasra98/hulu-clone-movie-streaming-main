# Hulu Clone - Movie Streaming

This project is a clone of the popular streaming platform Hulu, designed to provide a movie catalog with an easy-to-navigate user interface. The app allows users to browse movies by genre and search for specific titles, giving a similar experience to Hulu's platform, minus the streaming functionality.

## Features

- **Browse Movies by Genre**: Explore movies categorized by genre.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly search for your favorite movies.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User-friendly UI/UX**: Intuitive interface designed to enhance user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:  
  - Next JS
  - Tailwind CSS / Material UI (or other CSS frameworks)
  - Axios (for making API requests)
  
- **Other Tools**:
  - React Router (for navigation)
  - Firebase (optional, for authentication)

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hulu-clone-movie-streaming.git
   cd hulu-clone-movie-streaming
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   If you're using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or if you're using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## How It Works

- The application fetches movie data from an external API or mock data (such as The Movie Database API - TMDb).
- Users can browse movies by genre and use the search bar to find specific movies.
- The layout is responsive, ensuring it works smoothly across different screen sizes.
